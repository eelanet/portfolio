        <p>
          I am a Business Information Systems student at JAMK University of
          Applied Sciences. I have studied programming and web development for
          1,5 years. My passion is in both frontend and backend development. All my
          fullstack projects are MEAN-stack web applications. I've also done a
          couple Wordpress projects. At the moment my focus is in mobile
          development.

        <h3>Web Development - Frontend</h3>
        <p>
          I've spent most time in learning modern frontend web development. I
          have skills with basic HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. In addition to school courses I've done 300h
          Responsive Web Design course at FreeCodeCamp. Angular(6+) is the
          framework that I've played most with. I'm also familiar with the basics
          of jQuery.
        </p>

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>Web Development - Backend</h3>
        <p>
          My backend development knowledge is almost at the same level with
          frontend. I'm familiar with Nodejs and Express and I've used those
          in most of my projects that use RestAPI. I've connected my backend usually to MongoDb
          database with Mongoose and mySQL database with Sequelize.
        </p>

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>Mobile Development</h3>
        <p>
          I use web development technologies also when developing mobile apps. I have
          experience with PWA and Ionic apps. My latest intrest is in
          NativeScript. I have two ongoing NativeScript fullstack projects.
          I've also ongoing NativeScript+Angular course in Udemy.
